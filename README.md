## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Provide your Supabase credentials. Duplicate `.env.example` as `.env` and add your project keys:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The site runs at http://localhost:5173 by default.

## Features

- **Landing page** with hero mockup, feature highlights, and Supabase-backed waitlist form.
- **Waitlist form** stores email, RA goal (`note`), source, and UTM metadata inside the `waitlist` table.
- **Patient companion** at `/app` that demonstrates onboarding, daily risk monitoring, trigger detection, and clinician-ready weekly summaries.
- **Founder dashboard** at `/dashboard` that visualizes daily signups, source attribution, and conversion metrics using Recharts.
- **Responsive design** styled with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons.

## Supabase schema

The app expects a `waitlist` table with the following columns:

| Column      | Type     | Description                                |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `id`        | `uuid`   | Primary key                                |
| `email`     | `text`   | User email                                 |
| `note`      | `text`   | RA goal / context                          |
| `source`    | `text`   | Acquisition channel                        |
| `converted` | `bool`   | `true` if the user upgraded to a paid plan |
| `plan`      | `text`   | Subscription tier                          |
| `utm`       | `jsonb`  | Marketing UTM parameters                    |
| `created_at`| `timestamptz` | Timestamp generated by Supabase       |
